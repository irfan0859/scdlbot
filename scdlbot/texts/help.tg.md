Hi! I download and send audios from videos/tracks/sets/albums in *MP3 128 kbps* with tags and artwork. Files over 50 MB are split into parts due to Telegram Bot API limit.

*Usage:*
_Send or forward_ a text message containing links and I will:
• In *Download* mode: download every link I support (or use `/dl <links>`)
• In *Links* mode: show direct download URLs for every link (or use `/link <links>`)
• In *Ask* mode: scan for supported links and ask you to choose download or links
• Use /settings to select working mode for messages *without command*.
• Use /settings to toggle *Captions*.
• [Privacy mode](https://core.telegram.org/bots#privacy-mode) is _disabled_, so I scan every group message.
• Supported links and resources:
*SoundCloud*: tracks/playlists/pages with private widgets
*Bandcamp*: tracks/albums/custom links
*YouTube*: videos/playlists/not lives
*Mixcloud, Vimeo and* [everything from this list](https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/supportedsites.html) (no VK music)
